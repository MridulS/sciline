    "It is generally useful to be able to track the provenance of a dataset, that is, where it came from and how it was processed.\n",
    "Sciline can help because its task graphs encode the 'how'.\n",
    "To this end, a graph needs to be stored together with the processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that such graphs might be stored for a long time, they need to be serialized to a format that\n",
    "\n",
    "- represents the full structure of the graph,\n",
    "- is readable by software that does not depend on Sciline or Python,\n",
    "- is human readable (with some effort, the priority is machine readability).\n",
    "\n",
    "Points 2 and 3 exclude serializing the full Python objects, e.g., with `pickle`.\n",
    "But this means that any solution will be partial as it cannot capture the full environment that the pipeline is defined in.\n",
    "In particular, it cannot track functions called by providers that are external to the pipeline.\n",
    "See the section on [Reproducibility](#Reproducibility).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) objects produced by [Pipeline.visualize](../generated/classes/sciline.Pipeline.rst#sciline.Pipeline.visualize) are not sufficient because they do not encode the full graph structure but are instead optimized to give an overview of a task graph.\n",
